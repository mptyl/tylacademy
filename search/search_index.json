This repository provides a collection of markdown files designed to supercharge your feature development workflow with AI-powered IDEs and CLIs. These tools work with any AI coding assistant including Amp, Claude Code, Windsurf, and others. By leveraging these structured prompts, you can systematically approach building features, from ideation to implementation, with built-in checkpoints for verification.</p> <p>Stop wrestling with monolithic AI requests and start guiding your AI collaborator step-by-step!</p> <p>Building complex features with AI can sometimes feel like a black box. This workflow aims to bring structure, clarity, and control to the process by:</p> <p>Defining Scope: Clearly outlining what needs to be built with a Product Requirement Document (PRD). Detailed Planning: Breaking down the PRD into a granular, actionable task list. Iterative Implementation: Guiding the AI to tackle one task at a time, allowing you to review and approve each change. This structured approach helps ensure the AI stays on track, makes it easier to debug issues, and gives you confidence in the generated code.</p> <p>Github di ai-dev-tasks</p> <p>Video Youtube</p>"},{"location":"context_engineering/prompt_engineering/","title":"Prompt Engineering","text":"<p>Video Youtube - Smettila di dire a Claude Code cosa far</p> <p>Repo Github</p>"},{"location":"development-tools/","title":"Development Tools","text":"<p>Welcome to the Development Tools section.
